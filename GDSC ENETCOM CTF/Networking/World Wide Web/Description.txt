Web servers are pieces of software that "serve" ( as pointed out by the name ) web pages.
There are many web servers like httpd , nginx and Tomcat (but i am sure no one here plans to work at spiga).
Can you find out what is the web server used and its version **enum.chalghoum.tn** ?

Flag format : GDSC{WEBSERVER_VERSION}
Example : GDSC{TOMCAT_6.9.0}
