Once upon a time, in the land of cryptography, a group of brilliant minds, Ronny , Addy and Leonardo, embarked on a secret mission to create the ultimate code, one that even the most skilled hackers couldn't crack. They locked themselves in a top-secret lab, surrounded by stacks of books on math and computer science, and set to work on one of the first asymetric cryptography algorithms.

As the days turned into weeks and the weeks turned into months, strange noises could be heard emanating from the lab. Some said they heard the sound of frantic typing, others swore they heard the faint whispers of ancient mathematical formulas.
Years went by, and still, the group remained locked in their lab, toiling away in secrecy. But finally, one day, they emerged with a mysterious black box, which they claimed held the key to the ultimate code.

Well enough with the disney stuff..  our 'myterious black box' can only be opened using a passphrase. The passphrase has been encrypted with none other than... you guessed it right : RSA (honestly if you didn't get it, pay more attention , it has been staring at you in the face).

Anyways, you need to retrieve the passphrase using the information that you have.. pretty simple, pretty staightforward.
Go ahead and give me the passphrase to open the god damn box already..
