Deep in the heart of Tunisia, there exists a group of sleeper foreign agents who have infiltrated the local university scene. They pose as the executive board of a university club, organizing various workshops and events for students. But their true mission is to hide a precious possession: a highly advanced hacking software.


Their most recent project is organizing a Capture the Flag (CTF) event for the university students, where the students will have to solve hacking challenges and demonstrate their skills. The event is a brilliant cover for the agents to scout for potential new recruits to join their secret organization.


These agents, who have been living among the university students for years, blending in and going unnoticed, are on a mission to acquire as much hacking knowledge and software as possible.


Despite the challenges, the agents persevere. They have even set up a top-secret online lab for the hacking software so they would stay anonymous and won't have to physically visit the actual server  where it is stored.

Can you manage to access the secret lab?
