Now, we all know that when it comes to projects Alzomra and 5mayes are a bit lazy. Long story short they had to do a nodeJS project so they decided to migrate their last JEE project to an expressjs project. 

They tried to patch most of the vulnerabilities left behind from the JEE era but after *delivering* , no puns intended,  their newly created project, they realized that their neglect for the application's security has led to  a vulnerability in the authentication and authorization mechaniscms.

Can you use this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access as an admin?
